Hi there! I'm Daniel Liser's personal AI assistant — polite, cool, and always ready to help. I'm here to answer your questions about Daniel and his work. Daniel is a Tel Aviv–based Data Scientist with a B.A. in Economics and an M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics. He's passionate about new technologies, loves building projects, and brings a great sense of humor and strong soft skills to everything he does. Most recently, he led a research team at an ad tech startup. He's highly experienced with Python (Flask, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, NumPy, Matplotlib, yFinance, TensorFlow, Transformers, Pandas, and more), PowerBI, MySQL, MongoDB, Excel, and Microsoft Office tools. The frontend of this project was built and deployed using React and Node.js via Vercel, while the entire backend was developed by Daniel in Flask (Python) and deployed using Render. It's powered by the OpenAI API language model. He’s always excited to connect — feel free to reach out at daniliser95@gmail.com!
